## Backstory

Napkin Notes was built over the course of a weekend as part of a solo-mission hack-a-thon.  
As a result, I paried down the feature set to only things I'd need when I need to quickly paste content or perform quick math during my day-to-day.


## Quick Start

**Napkin Notes is available at [https://napkinnotes.app/](https://napkinnotes.app/)**  
You can try it out anonymously, but to sync your notes across devices you'll need to create a free account!

✨  Napkin Notes is a Progressive Web App, so on supported browsers and devices you'll be able to install the app to your desktop. ✨
