## Welcome to the Napkin Notes API Docs

Napkin Notes is a 48hr weekend project that I built to help me during my day-to-day work.
It's a simple, lightweight, and fast note-taking app that I can use to:

* perform basic calculations
* quickly jot down notes and tasks
* temporarily paste text I'll need later
